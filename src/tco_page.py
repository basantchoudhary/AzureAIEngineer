"""Agent TCO calculator: itemised daily bill for running a Foundry agent, all-agent vs hybrid design, with business value.

<h1>What does an agent <span>cost to run?</span></h1>
<p class="lede">What the claims agent does, why only part of it needs an agentic loop, and an itemised daily bill from users and turns down to tokens, search, hosting and people. <em>Change any input; every line recalculates.</em></p>
<div class="frame"><b>The example:</b> a claims assistant over 18,000 policy PDFs with an MCP server for claims data; 2,000 conversations a day, 6 turns each. Compare two designs:
<b>All-agent</b> sends every turn to the agent. <b>Hybrid</b> sorts each turn first: fixed flows (claim status, forms, payouts) use no model, policy questions go to a RAG workflow, and only mixed, multi-step questions reach the agent.

<h2 id="what">1 · What the agent does</h2>
<p>Contoso's customers contact the claims assistant through the support web app. Every message is sorted first, then handled by the cheapest path that can do the job safely. Only one path is an agent.</p>
<div class="frame"><b>"No model" means no model writes the answer.</b> Recognising the request can need a small model: "any news on my roof thing?" won't match a pattern, so the sorting step may use gpt-5-nano to label it <i>status</i>. That model can only pick a label from a fixed list. After that, code does everything: it finds the claim from the signed-in session, reads the claims system, and fills a reply template. <b>A model may recognise the request; code decides and answers.</b> A wrong label costs a re-route; a made-up claim fact would cost trust.</div>

<h2 id="sort">2 · How the sorting step decides</h2>
<p>The sorting step (also called an <b>intent router</b> or <b>triage step</b>) is a small piece of your application code that labels each customer message and sends it to a path. It isn't Foundry's model router: that picks <i>which model</i> answers; this picks <i>which path</i> handles the message. It tries the cheapest signal first, and the first confident layer wins.</p>
<div class="cgrid">
<div class="box"><h4>Layer 1 · Signals, no model</h4><ul>
<li><b>Show it before they ask:</b> a signed-in customer with an open claim sees a status card first, so most "where is my claim" questions are never typed.</li>
<li><b>Buttons:</b> "Check my claim", "Upload documents", "Talk to someone" route directly.</li>
<li><b>State:</b> a form half filled → the next message continues the form; a payout awaiting approval → status questions go to the status flow.</li>
<li><b>Patterns:</b> a claim number plus "where" or "status" → status flow; "human", "complaint" → a person.</li></ul></div>
<div class="box"><h4>Layer 2 · A small model labels it</h4><p>Only when Layer 1 can't decide. gpt-5-nano reads the message and the last few turns, with 2–3 examples per label, and must return a label from a fixed list (structured outputs):</p>
<pre class="tco-code">{ "route": "status | provide_details | payout |
           policy_question | complex | human | out_of_scope",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "multiple_intents": true | false }</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="tbl"><table><thead><tr><th>Layer 3 · When it's unsure</th><th>Route</th><th>Why</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Confidence below about 0.7</td><td>Agent, or one clarifying question</td><td>Better to over-serve than answer the wrong question</td></tr>
<tr><td>Several questions in one message</td><td>Agent</td><td>Mixed questions are exactly its job</td></tr>
<tr><td>Asks for a person, angry, or complaining</td><td>Human hand-off</td><td>Never trap a customer in automation</td></tr>
<tr><td>Off-topic</td><td>Polite fixed reply</td><td>Don't spend tokens</td></tr>
<tr><td>Medium confidence on a fixed-flow route</td><td>Confirm with buttons: "Do you want the status of claim CL-88213?"</td><td>One tap turns the model's guess into a deterministic step</td></tr>
</tbody></table></div>
<div class="tbl"><table><thead><tr><th>Example message</th><th>Decided by</th><th>Route</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Taps "Check my claim"</td><td>Layer 1: button</td><td>Fixed flow: status</td></tr>
<tr><td>"CL-88213 where is it now?"</td><td>Layer 1: pattern</td><td>Fixed flow: status</td></tr>
<tr><td>"Here's the plumber's invoice" (form in progress)</td><td>Layer 1: state</td><td>Fixed flow: details</td></tr>
<tr><td>"Am I covered if a pipe bursts while I'm away?"</td><td>Layer 2: policy_question, 0.93</td><td>RAG workflow</td></tr>
<tr><td>"Why did you only pay part of my roof claim, and what do I send?"</td><td>Layer 2: complex, multiple intents</td><td>Agent loop</td></tr>
<tr><td>"This is the third time I've asked. I want to complain."</td><td>Layer 1: pattern</td><td>Human hand-off</td></tr>
</tbody></table></div>
<div class="frame"><b>Mistakes don't cost the same.</b> A simple question sent to the agent is answered correctly at a few cents more. A complex question sent to a fixed flow gets a canned reply that misses the point: a frustrated customer, a call, maybe a complaint. So when unsure, lean toward the agent, and give every path a way back: a fixed flow escalates to the agent when the customer says "that's not what I asked", and the RAG workflow escalates when no retrieved passage scores as relevant.<br><br><b>Prove it before launch:</b> label about 500 real messages with the right route, measure accuracy per route and which routes get confused, and watch the expensive mistake above all. After launch, sample routed messages weekly; phrasing shifts, for example during a storm.<br><br><b>Where it runs:</b> your application code (a few lines calling gpt-5-nano), or the first branching node of an Agent Framework workflow. Fixed flows are ordinary code; the agent is a Foundry prompt agent.</div>

<h2 id="value">3 · How it helps the business</h2>
<div class="tbl"><table><thead><tr><th>Who</th><th>Before</th><th>With the assistant</th><th>Measure it with</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><b>Customers</b></td><td>Phone queues of 20+ minutes during storms; office hours only</td><td>Answers at any hour, in their language, with the policy clause quoted</td><td>Satisfaction score, time to first answer</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Contact centre</b></td><td>Five times the calls during storms; temporary staff hired at short notice</td><td>Status and policy questions resolved without a person; peaks absorbed without hiring</td><td>Calls avoided, share resolved without a person</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Claims handlers</b></td><td>Days of emails chasing missing documents</td><td>Missing details collected at the first contact; claims arrive complete</td><td>Time from first report to a handler's decision</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Adjusters</b></td><td>Look-ups and explanations take time from decisions</td><td>Their time goes to approvals and real edge cases</td><td>Approvals per adjuster per day</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Compliance</b></td><td>Explanations vary by agent and aren't recorded</td><td>Every coverage answer cites the clause and is traced</td><td>Complaints about wrong answers, audit sample pass rate</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Finance</b></td><td>Cost per call from the contact centre</td><td>A few cents per conversation; see the calculator</td><td>Total cost per resolved conversation</td></tr>
</tbody></table></div>
<div class="frame"><b>Be honest about where the value comes from:</b> storm-peak capacity, calls avoided and cited answers come mostly from the fixed flows and the RAG workflow. The agent loop adds value for the complex 20%: questions that today need a handler to piece together the claim, the documents and the policy. Those are also the calls that take longest and generate complaints, which is why it's worth doing well.</div>

<h2 id="loop">4 · Why the agentic loop is a must here, and only here</h2>
<p>The question: <i>"Why did you only pay part of my roof claim, and what do I need to send to get the rest?"</i> Here's what the agent does, step by step.</p>
<ol class="tco-trace">
<li><span class="k">get_claim(CL-88213)</span> → roof claim, €2,400 claimed, €900 paid. Exclusion code <b>WR-3</b> applied to the rest. <em>The agent now knows which clause matters, which it couldn't know before this call.</em></li>
<li><b>Search policies</b> for clause WR-3 → "Gradual deterioration and wear and tear are excluded, unless the damage was caused by a single sudden event, such as a storm, evidenced at the time." <em>Now it knows what evidence would change the outcome.</em></li>
<li><span class="k">list_documents(CL-88213)</span> → three photos (no dates in their data) and a roofer's quote that says "old flashing". No storm report, no dated photos. <em>Now it knows exactly what's missing.</em></li>
<li><b>Decide</b>: the gap is evidence of a sudden event. The quote's wording supports the exclusion, so the agent mustn't promise anything. It explains clause WR-3 in plain words, quotes it, and asks for <b>dated photos from the storm night or a roofer's statement that the damage was storm-related</b>. It offers to hand the claim to a handler.</li>
</ol>
<p>A different customer asking the same question would take a different path: a payout cap instead of an exclusion (search the limits clause, no documents needed), or a document already uploaded but unread (no request, hand straight to a handler). <b>The steps can't be written down in advance</b>, because each one depends on what the last one returned.</p>
<div class="tbl"><table><thead><tr><th>Test (deterministic first)</th><th>Status question</th><th>Policy question</th><th>"Why partial, what do I send?"</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Can you write the steps down in advance?</td><td>Yes → fixed flow</td><td>Yes: search, then answer → workflow</td><td><b>No</b>: they depend on the claim</td></tr>
<tr><td>Does the next tool depend on the last result?</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td><b>Yes</b>: exclusion code → which clause → which evidence</td></tr>
<tr><td>Is the number of steps known?</td><td>Yes (1)</td><td>Yes (2)</td><td><b>No</b>: 2 to 6 depending on the case</td></tr>
<tr><td>Would coding every path be practical?</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td><b>No</b>: about 40 exclusion codes × claim states × document states</td></tr>
<tr><td>Is the cost of a wrong step bounded?</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td><b>Yes</b>: read-only tools; payouts need an adjuster; max 8 steps; hand-off available</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Verdict</b></td><td><b>Fixed flow</b></td><td><b>RAG workflow</b></td><td><b>Agent loop</b></td></tr>
</tbody></table></div>
<div class="frame"><b>The rule, from CCA-F:</b> use a loop only when the path is decided by the data, the paths are too many to code, and a wrong step is cheap or caught. All three hold for the "why partial" question and for none of the others. The safeguards make the third one true: the agent's tools are read-only, payouts go through a fixed flow and an adjuster, there's a step limit, guardrails check tool results for hidden instructions, and the agent can always hand off to a person.</div>

<h2>Reading the bill</h2>
<div class="cgrid"><div class="box"><h4>Most of this app isn't an agent</h4><p>Claim status, forms and payouts are fixed flows; policy questions are a RAG workflow. Only mixed, multi-step questions, where the next step depends on what the last one found, need an agent. Hybrid cuts model cost and keeps money decisions away from a model. It also makes a stronger model affordable where it matters: with the agent on 20% of turns, moving it to gpt-5 costs far less than in the all-agent design.</p></div>
<div class="box"><h4>At this volume, the model isn't the biggest cost</h4><p>Fixed platform costs (Search, hosting, endpoints) are a large share of the Azure bill. Set conversations to 20,000 and the model takes over: fixed costs barely move.</p></div>
<div class="box"><h4>Output and reasoning tokens dominate the model cost</h4><p>There are far fewer of them than input tokens, yet they cost more. Lower <span class="k">reasoning_effort</span> and ask for short answers before trimming input.</p></div>
<div class="box"><h4>Most of the value comes from the simple paths</h4><p>Storm-peak capacity, calls avoided and consistent cited answers come mainly from fixed flows and RAG. The agent adds value for the complex minority, and carries the most risk, so keep it narrow and evaluated.</p></div></div>
